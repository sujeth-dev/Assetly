# PLOT — Structural Map of the Assetly Site

Persistent orientation context: how this codebase is *shaped*. It exists so an agent can find the
right file without grepping the tree.

It is deliberately **not** a second copy of the planning documents. `planning/` remains authoritative
for product spec, phase state, and decision history; this file names the structure and links out.

## Architecture

Next.js 16 App Router, React 19, TypeScript, CSS Modules, Firebase (client + admin SDKs). Vitest for
units, Playwright for flows.

Four layers, confirmed against the dependency graph — dependencies point downward only:

```
app/            routes and shells      app/(site)/{page,layout,about,privacy,terms}, app/admin,
                                        app/admin/login, app/layout, app/sitemap.ts, app/robots.ts
components/     section components     hero compare why-us sectors contact nav footer brand
                                        trusted-by, admin (auth-gated, Phase 3)
components/primitives  +  components/plate     ← core, high fan-in, no outbound deps
lib/            hooks and pure logic                                ← core, high fan-in
content/        copy and artwork data (no behaviour)
```

**`components/primitives/`** (fan-in 23) — `Container`, `Eyebrow`, `SerifHeading`, `RevealOnScroll`,
`SiteLinkAnchor`. Every section composes these; changing one touches the whole site.

**`components/legal/`** — `LegalPageBody`, shared by `/privacy` and `/terms` (Phase 9). Same plain
typographic register as `/about`; each route supplies its own `LegalContent` from `content/legal/*`
and its own `metadata` export. `app/layout.tsx` sets `metadataBase` so every route's relative
canonical/OG URL resolves; `app/sitemap.ts`/`app/robots.ts` cover `/` and `/about` only, `/admin`
stays `noindex` and excluded.

**`lib/motion/`** (fan-in 16) — the motion system, and the densest cluster in the repo. Scroll
(`useScrollTick`, `useScrollFocus`, `scrollFocus`), drawers (`useDrawerOpenness`, `drawerOpenness`),
draw-on-enter (`useDrawOnEnter`), rotation (`sectorRotation`, `useOneOutOneIn` — `paused` stops the
grid, `holdSlot` steps past one slot), media queries
(`useMediaQuery`, incl. `usePrefersReducedMotion`), and the Hero opening
(`useHeroLoaderSequence`, `homeOpeningReplay`).

**`content/`** holds copy and plate artwork as data — `content/plates/*` are SVG plate definitions,
`content/site/*` and `content/{about,compare,contact,sectors,why-us}/*` are copy. Copy changes belong
here, not in components. `ABOUT_CONTENT.paragraphs` is an ordered, owner-verbatim array rather than a
single body string; the About route maps it without rewriting it (DEC-050).

One file there is **generated, not authored**: `content/plates/bengaluru-map.ts` is OpenStreetMap
geometry for the six kilometres around the office, projected and simplified into static paths
(DEC-033). Its header carries the bounding box, projection and simplification tolerances. Regenerate
it from Overpass to change the window; hand-editing the numbers makes the map geographically wrong,
which is the one thing it exists to prevent.

**`lib/firebase/`** splits `client.ts` and `admin.ts` (browser vs. server SDK init), each behind an
`isFirebaseConfigured()`/`isFirebaseAdminConfigured()` guard so the site renders without credentials,
plus their Phase 3 consumers: `auth.ts` (admin sign-in/out — DEC-057, one account, no allowlist beyond
"signed in to this project"), `firestore.ts` (typed `siteSections/trustedBy` /
`trustedLogos/{logoId}` live-subscription accessors — every read degrades to `null`/`[]` on failure
rather than throwing), `storage.ts` (logo upload/delete; delete resolves the Storage object straight
from the stored download URL, so no extra storage-path field is needed). Firestore/Storage are scoped
to Trusted-By content only (DEC-011). `lib/trustedBy/reorder.ts` holds the reorder math as pure,
Firestore-free functions. `lib/validation/logoUpload.ts` is the Zod counterpart to
`lib/validation/contactForm.ts`.

**`components/admin/`** — `AdminGate` (client-side auth gate wrapping every `/admin` route via
`app/admin/layout.tsx`; exposes the signed-in user through `useAdminUser()`), `LoginForm`,
`SignOutButton`, `SectionToggle`, `LogoUploadForm`, `LogoManager`. One shared `Admin.module.css` —
deliberately small/utilitarian (`OD-07`), not a themed surface. **`components/trusted-by/`** —
`TrustedBy` (renders `null` unless enabled AND non-empty, §12) and `LogoMarquee` (duplicated-sequence
CSS loop, repeats the real collection to fill a wide viewport when there are few logos, only the
genuine pass is screen-reader-visible).

### Section anatomy

Sections follow one shape: `XSection.tsx` (composition) + `X.module.css` (style) + optional
interactive children. Compare and Contact each carry a responsive pair — `CalculatorDrawer` /
`CalculatorSheet`, `ContactDrawer` / `ContactSheet` — desktop drawer, mobile sheet, not one component
reflowed.

### The homepage chain

```
HomePage → HeroOpening → HeroLoader          (opening overlay)
                       → Hero                (hands off to the Hero mark)
         → TrustedBy      (renders nothing unless enabled + non-empty, §12)
         → CompareSection → WhyUsSection → SectorsSection → ContactSection
```

`HeroOpening` owns the loader/Hero hand-off; `useHeroLoaderSequence` drives phases and calls
`completeHomeOpening`. Replay is module-scope state in `homeOpeningReplay.ts` — not storage — so the
opening plays on every full document load of `/` and never on client-side navigation.

## Load-bearing conventions

Constraints that are invisible in the code but break things when violated. Full reasoning in
`DECISIONS.md`; these are the ones that change how you write a patch.

- **Reduced motion is mandatory.** Anything animated neutralizes under `prefers-reduced-motion`
  (SOURCE_OF_TRUTH §8).
- **Mobile is recomposed, not shrunk** (§9) — hence the drawer/sheet pairs.
- **Section blocks size against viewport height, not width** (DEC-028). Width-capped grid cells were
  the defect the automated suite could not see.
- **Use `--nav-block`, never `--nav-h`, to clear the fixed nav** (DEC-020).
- **Never invent business facts.** Missing copy becomes an `OPEN DECISION` in §25, not a plausible
  placeholder.
- **`overflow: clip`, never `hidden`, on a box that hides something parked outside it** (DEC-036).
  `hidden` makes a scroll container, and anything — focus, find-in-page, script — will scroll it to
  reach what is parked there. That was the contact drawer appearing to shove the whole composition
  sideways.
- **The document reserves its scrollbar gutter** (DEC-036), so a fixed box laid out in the initial
  containing block stops short of the window edge. Anything meant to cover the whole window uses
  `100vw`, and never mix `vw` with `%` across that boundary — the Compare column and its drawer both
  read one `--compare-drawer-width` for exactly that reason. The Hero loader is the second instance of
  this trap: its overlay, mark axis and tagline axis all use `vw`, and the mark/tagline share the
  `--opening-mark-size` source so their gap cannot drift across breakpoints. Its root canvas is Pitch
  while the loader exists because Chromium paints the reserved gutter above fixed children (DEC-060).
- **Compare's focus effect rests across a band, not at a point** (DEC-034). A slide is sharp for 0.26
  viewport heights either side of centre (0.34 on mobile) before any blur begins.
- **Compare tiers are qualitative.** The shared set is `minimal | low | mid | high`; `minimal` is the
  fourth, 16% presentation step and is used only for Upfront Cash's Lease bar (DEC-048). It is not a
  numeric financing claim.
- **`.face` is `overflow: hidden`** — a flip card shorter than its copy truncates it silently, with no
  test failure. Measure at both breakpoints.
- **A Firestore query combining `where` on one field with `orderBy` on another needs a composite
  index** — Firestore doesn't auto-create these, and the failure (`failed-precondition`) is exactly
  the kind of error `lib/firebase/firestore.ts`'s silent-failure contract swallows into `[]`, so a
  missing index looks identical to "no data" on the public site with nothing in the browser console to
  flag it. `subscribeActiveTrustedLogos`'s `where("active","==",true) + orderBy("sortOrder","asc")`
  needed one (`firestore.indexes.json`, created via the console link Firestore's own error message
  provides). Check this first if a Trusted-By-shaped "the data's there but the section won't show up"
  report ever recurs, or before adding another compound query anywhere in the app.

- **The admin dashboard cannot be reached by any automated test.** `AdminGate` is a client component
  that renders nothing until Firebase reports a signed-in user, so `/admin` server-renders only the
  "checking access" screen and `admin.spec.ts` covers the login route alone. To audit the workspace's
  layout, render it outside the gate from a throwaway route and delete that route afterwards.
- **The admin's `<h1>` is the workspace, not a section** (DEC-067). Trusted By is one section block
  inside it, and a second managed section should be a section block plus a list entry - not a
  restructure. Headings run h1 workspace, h2 section, h3 panel, h4 sub-panel.

- **Never size a child with a percentage height inside a box whose height came from `aspect-ratio`.**
  A percentage height should resolve against the containing block's *content* box; WebKit resolves it
  against the border box when that height came from `aspect-ratio`, so a padded frame renders the
  child at the full frame height. With `overflow: hidden` on the frame, the result is silent: the
  child eats the bottom padding and the bottom border, and the box looks cropped along one edge only.
  Put the ratio on the child and let the frame size from its content instead — see
  `about/About.module.css` `.media`/`.mediaImage` (DEC-068). The Chromium-only suite cannot see this
  class of fault; check it with a WebKit run when a framed, padded, ratio-driven box is introduced.
- **A frame that is 16:9 *including* its padding leaves a content box flatter than 16:9**, so an image
  at the same ratio with `object-fit: cover` is quietly cropped. This is engine-independent and was
  losing about 24px off the About photograph at every width.

- **The palette has exactly one saturated colour, and it is the Compare graph's Lease bar**
  (DEC-069). Everything else is a §6 token or a `color-mix` of two. The reason is measured rather
  than aesthetic: Bottle's chroma is about 0.043, and mixing it with Paper only removes more, so no
  mix reads as green at bar size. If another surface ever needs a vivid accent, reuse that value
  rather than inventing a second one.
- **Anything inside `.fill` in the Compare graph is drawn through `transform: scaleY()`** — outlines,
  shadows and any child are squashed vertically in proportion to the tier, hard on the `minimal` tier
  where the bar is about 24px of a 270px track. Position siblings against `--tier-scale` instead, and
  keep edge effects small enough that the distortion does not read.

### Testing traps

- `test.use({ reducedMotion })` does not reach the page here. Use `page.emulateMedia({ reducedMotion: "reduce" })`.
- Unregistered custom properties read back as literal `clamp(...)` text and parse as `NaN`. Measure
  elements, don't parse tokens.
- The browser suite is **tiered by tag**, so the whole of it need not run on every change:
  `npm run test:e2e:fast` (`@fast`, 22 cases) is the everyday gate; `npm run test:e2e` (65) runs
  before a phase commit; `npm run test:e2e:motion` (`@motion`, 12, serial) runs after touching
  loader or plate timing. A single spec still runs on its own: `npx playwright test contact`.
- Playwright runs **in parallel**. The old `--workers=1` rule was for false failures on the WebKit
  mobile sheet; WebKit was removed in DEC-063 and the reason went with it. `@motion` keeps
  `--workers=1` because those cases measure animation timing.
- **Every load of `/` sits through the ~4.8s opening**, absorbed by `tests/e2e/support/opening.ts`.
  That is the suite's dominant fixed cost, so a spec that sweeps viewport widths should `goto` once
  and call `setViewportSize` per width — CSS reflows on resize and a fresh document buys nothing.
- `playwright.config.ts` sets `reuseExistingServer` — an existing dev server on :3000 is reused.

## State

Phases 0–2, 4–8, 8.5 and 9 complete on `main`, together with a refinement pass over the shipped
homepage (DEC-032–DEC-039). `phase/hero-opening-loader` is **merged**; `HeroLoader`, `HeroOpening`,
`useHeroLoaderSequence` and `homeOpeningReplay` are on `main`, and every spec that loads `/` now
loads the ~4.8s opening with it.

Two conventions the opening imposes: `HERO_LOADER_DURATIONS.signature` and the
`loaderDoubleBlink` animation duration in `Hero.module.css` are the same number in two places and
must be changed together; and the loader's Hero destination is measured from
`[data-hero-mark-target]` rather than parsed from its `clamp()` token.

Phase 3 (Firebase / Trusted By) is **complete and exited** — built, tested (124 Vitest + 130 Playwright,
all green), security rules and the required composite index (`firestore.indexes.json`) deployed to the
live Firebase project, and the full admin→public loop confirmed working end-to-end by the owner
against real data. `OD-05`/`OD-06` are both resolved (`DEC-057`). Open items `OD-01`, `OD-02`, `OD-07`,
`OD-13`, `OD-14` gate Phase 10 / deployment. Per `DEC-054`, per-task verification now defaults to manual
dev-server preview + owner approval rather than a required Vitest/Playwright pass per task — see
`LOOP.md` step 5.

`planning/PROGRESS.md` is the live record — it is rewritten each cycle and wins over this summary.

## Maintaining this file

Update `plot.md` when the **structure** changes: a new module or layer, a dependency direction, a new
load-bearing convention, or a phase moving to done. Do not log routine tasks here — that is
`PROGRESS.md`'s job. Re-index Codebase Memory in the same pass.
